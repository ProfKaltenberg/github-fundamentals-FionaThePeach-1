# I hope this is right 

### I may or may not have any idea of what I am doing 

What I have learned 
- Jupyter note book is where you do all the coding and writing and fun stuff like that 
- Github dashboard is all the repositories (project folders) that are stored on my computer
- Github is like google docs/facebook/classes 
  - Branches are a copy of a master repository, you can make changes on it, send it to your team, and then merge it to the master. makes sure you dont bug up the baseline code. 
  - Pull requests and commiting are the action of sending up the changed made to your branches 
  - Issues are like your to do lists with coding, things you want to get done
- I got down the markdown code so thats *fun* 

What Im confused about 
- I do my coding on jupyter notes book and then I send it over to GitHub? Where do I send it to? How do I send it over? Do I send it to github desktop and then do a pull request? What is the point of GithubDesktop? 
- Does this count as a markdown file? Is ther a diffrent wway I should be doing this?

I am not going to try to put this on githubdesk top and then do a pull request to github. No idea if this is right but I need to try :)
